Cleanup script to remove duplicate Canvas events from Google Calendar.

This script identifies and removes duplicate Canvas events that were created
due to the event ID generation issue. It keeps the most recent version of
each event based on the Canvas UID.

Usage:
    python cleanup_duplicates.py [--dry-run]

Options:
    --dry-run: Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
