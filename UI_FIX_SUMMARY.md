# UI Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Problem
The calendar UI was displaying events incorrectly with the following issues:
1. **Events too tall** - Events were stretching across many hours when they should only span their actual duration
2. **Overlapping/unreadable text** - Event titles and times were overlapping and hard to read
3. **Poor positioning** - Events weren't aligned properly with the time grid
4. **Excessive height for short events** - Even 30-minute events were taking up too much vertical space

### Root Causes
1. **Incorrect height calculation** - The calculation for event height had multiple steps that could introduce errors
2. **Overflow handling** - Events were set to `overflow: visible` by default, causing layout issues
3. **Text sizing** - Font sizes and line heights weren't optimized for compact display
4. **Padding issues** - Too much padding made short events appear larger than needed

## Changes Made

### JavaScript (`app/static/app.js`)

**Simplified event positioning calculation:**
```javascript
// Old: Complex calculation with multiple clamping steps
let top = clampMinutes(minutesSinceStart(event.start)) * HOUR_HEIGHT / 60;
const durationMinutes = Math.max((event.end - event.start) / 60000, 30);
let height = (Math.min(clampMinutes(...), ...) - clampMinutes(...)) * HOUR_HEIGHT / 60;

// New: Clean, straightforward calculation
const startMinutes = minutesSinceStart(event.start);
const endMinutes = minutesSinceStart(event.end);
const clampedStart = clampMinutes(startMinutes);
const clampedEnd = clampMinutes(endMinutes);
const top = clampedStart * (HOUR_HEIGHT / 60);
const height = Math.max((clampedEnd - clampedStart) * (HOUR_HEIGHT / 60), 24);
```

**Smart content display for short events:**
- Events < 40px height now only show title (not time/location)
- Full details always available on hover
- Tooltip shows all information regardless of event size

### CSS (`app/static/styles.css`)

**Event card improvements:**
- Reduced padding from `0.4rem 0.6rem` to `0.3rem 0.5rem`
- Changed `overflow: visible` to `overflow: hidden` by default
- Added subtle border: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)`
- Reduced min-height from `24px` to `20px`
- Added `padding-right: 1.5rem` to make space for delete button

**Text sizing optimizations:**
- Title: `0.75rem` → `0.72rem` with better line-height
- Time: `0.75rem` → `0.65rem`
- Location: `0.7rem` → `0.6rem`
- All text now uses `text-overflow: ellipsis` with `white-space: nowrap`

**Hover effects:**
- Changed from `transform: translateY(-1px)` to `transform: scale(1.02)`
- Reduced shadow intensity
- Only show overflow on hover (reveals full text)

**Delete button:**
- Reduced size from `20px` to `18px`
- Lighter background: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)`
- Better positioning: `top: 3px; right: 3px`

## Visual Improvements

### Before
- Events stretched way too tall (all-day appearance)
- Text overlapping and unreadable
- Wasted vertical space
- Poor alignment with time grid

### After
- Events correctly sized to their actual duration
- Clean, readable text that truncates gracefully
- Compact display maximizes visible schedule
- Perfect alignment with 30-minute grid
- Hover shows full details when needed

## How Events Display Now

**30-minute event:**
- Height: 24px (minimum)
- Shows: Title only
- Hover: Full title + time + location

**1-hour event:**
- Height: 48px
- Shows: Title + time
- Hover: Full details with location if available

**2+ hour event:**
- Height: Proportional (96px+)
- Shows: Title + time + location
- Hover: Enhanced view with all details

## Technical Details

### Pixel-to-Time Mapping
- `HOUR_HEIGHT = 48px` (defined in config)
- Each minute = `48/60 = 0.8px`
- 30-minute slot = `24px`
- Events are positioned and sized in exact pixels based on their start/end times

### Grid Alignment
- Time grid uses 30-minute slots (24px each)
- Events snap to exact minute positions
- Background grid lines at 24px (half-hour) and 48px (hour) intervals

### Responsive Text
- Short events (<40px): Title only
- Medium events (40-80px): Title + time
- Tall events (>80px): Title + time + location
- All events: Full tooltip on hover

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- CSS uses standard properties (no experimental features)
- Hover effects use CSS transforms (hardware accelerated)
- Text ellipsis supported in all major browsers

## Performance
- No JavaScript needed for hover effects (pure CSS)
- Efficient rendering with absolute positioning
- Minimal reflows during scroll
- Hardware-accelerated transforms

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various event durations:**
   - 15 minutes (should show as 24px minimum)
   - 30 minutes (should show as 24px)
   - 1 hour (should show as 48px)
   - 2+ hours (should scale proportionally)

2. **Test overlapping events:**
   - Multiple events at same time
   - Should render in columns side-by-side
   - Should maintain readability

3. **Test hover functionality:**
   - Hover should reveal full text
   - Delete button should appear
   - Event should slightly enlarge

4. **Test with long titles:**
   - Should truncate with ellipsis (...)
   - Full text visible on hover
   - Tooltip should show all details

5. **Test different event sources:**
   - Google Calendar (blue)
   - Harvard Canvas (red)
   - MIT Canvas (purple)
   - All should render consistently
