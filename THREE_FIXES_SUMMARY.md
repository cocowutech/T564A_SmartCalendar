# Three Fixes Summary

## 1. ✅ All-Day Section Remains When Days Deselected

### Problem
When you deselected all day filter buttons (M, T, W, T, F, S, S), the entire all-day events section would disappear from the right panel.

### Solution
Modified `updateAllDayEvents()` function to:
1. Check if there are **any** all-day events in the week first
2. If yes, always show the section
3. If all days are deselected, show message: "Select days above to see events"
4. Only hide the section if there are truly **no** all-day events in the entire week

### Code Changes
**File**: `app/static/app.js`
- Added logic to detect all-day events before day filtering
- Show empty state message instead of hiding section when filters exclude all events

### Result
- Section stays visible when all days are deselected
- Shows helpful message to re-select days
- Only hides when there are genuinely no all-day events that week

## 2. ✅ Course & Event Filters Hidden

### Problem
The "Course & Event Filters" section was taking up space in the left sidebar and may have been filtering out events.

### Solution
1. **Hidden the section** with `style="display: none;"`
2. **Disabled course filtering logic** - `getFilteredEvents()` now returns all events
3. All events are now shown regardless of course codes

### Code Changes
**File**: `app/static/index.html`
- Added `style="display: none;"` to Course & Event Filters section

**File**: `app/static/app.js`
- Modified `getFilteredEvents()` to always return all events
- Old filtering logic kept as comments for reference

### Result
- Filter section completely hidden from UI
- All events display without filtering
- More space in left sidebar for other controls

## 3. ⚠️ Google Calendar Holidays - Diagnostic Added

### Problem
Holidays from Google Calendar may not appear in the Smart Calendar.

### Root Cause
Google Calendar holidays are typically in a **separate calendar** (e.g., "Holidays in United States") that is different from your primary calendar. The app currently only syncs from the primary calendar.

### Solution Implemented
Added **diagnostic logging** to help identify the issue:

**File**: `app/static/app.js`
- When events load, console logs now show:
  ```
  Loaded 25 events: 20 timed, 5 all-day
  Sample all-day events: ["Event 1", "Event 2", ...]
  ```

### How to Check
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Sync All Sources" or refresh
3. Check the console output
4. If holidays are missing from the sample list, they're not in your primary calendar

### Permanent Solutions

**Option A: Quick Fix**
- In Google Calendar, copy holidays to your primary calendar
- They will then sync automatically

**Option B: Configuration Fix**
- Find your holiday calendar ID in Google Calendar settings
- This looks like: `en.usa#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com`
- Could be added to `.env` as: `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary,en.usa#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com`
- (Note: Current code only supports one calendar ID, would need enhancement to support multiple)

**Option C: Code Enhancement** (Future)
- Modify `services/google_calendar.py` to fetch from multiple calendars
- Merge results from primary + holidays + any other subscribed calendars

### Documentation
Created `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_HOLIDAYS_NOTE.md` with detailed explanation and solutions.
