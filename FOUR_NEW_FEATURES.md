# Four New Features Implemented

## 1. ✅ AI Suggestions Avoid Taken Time Slots

### How It Works
The voice/AI service **already includes conflict detection**! When you request suggestions:

1. **Fetches existing events** from Google Calendar
2. **Analyzes your calendar** for the time range (this week, next 3 days, etc.)
3. **Finds free slots** that don't conflict with existing events
4. **Applies smart rules**:
   - 15-minute buffer before/after existing events
   - Rounds to 15-minute intervals
   - Respects working hours (8 AM - 8 PM by default)
   - Minimum 60-minute gap between suggestions

### Code Location
`services/voice.py` lines 248-287:
```python
async def _find_free_slots(...):
    # Get existing events
    existing_events = await self.calendar_service.list_events(
        settings=settings,
        time_min=now,
        time_max=end_date,
        max_results=500
    )
    # Then finds slots that don't conflict
```

### How to Use
1. Type: "I want to study for 2 hours 3 times this week"
2. Click "Generate Suggestions"
3. AI finds free slots avoiding your existing events
4. Select which times work for you

### Example
If you have:
- Monday 2-4 PM: Class
- Tuesday 10 AM-12 PM: Meeting

AI will suggest times like:
- Monday 10 AM - 12 PM ✅ (free)
- Tuesday 2 PM - 4 PM ✅ (free)
- Wednesday 3 PM - 5 PM ✅ (free)

NOT:
- Monday 2 PM - 4 PM ❌ (conflicts with class)
- Tuesday 10 AM - 12 PM ❌ (conflicts with meeting)

## 2. ✅ Manual Add Event Button

### What Changed
The **"➕ Add Activity"** button (top right) now opens a **manual event creation form** instead of the AI text input.

### Features
- **Quick form** to add events directly
- **Fields**:
  - Event Title (required)
  - Date (pre-filled with selected date)
  - Start Time / End Time
  - All-day event checkbox
  - Location (optional)
  - Description (optional)
- **Validation**: Checks for required fields and valid times
- **Instant sync**: Event appears immediately after creation

### How to Use
1. Click **"➕ Add Activity"** (top right corner)
2. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Team Meeting"
   - Date: Select date
   - Time: 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM
   - Location: "Zoom" (optional)
3. Click **"Create Event"**
4. Event is added to Google Calendar and appears immediately

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Escape` to close the modal
- Click outside the modal to close

## 3. ✅ Week/Month Toggle Hidden

### What Changed
The **Week/Month** toggle buttons are now hidden from the header.

### Before:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Week][Month]  [Refresh]  [Add]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           [Refresh]  [Add Activity] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Reason
- Only week view is implemented
- Month toggle was disabled/non-functional
- Cleaner header without unused buttons

---

## 4. ✅ Calendar Aware of Today and Current Time

### Feature A: Today's Date Highlighted

**Visual Indicators:**
- Today's column has **green tinted background**
- Small **green dot** (●) in top right of header
- Different border color (green vs purple for selected)

**CSS Classes:**
- `.today` - Applied to today's day header
- Green color theme for current day

### Feature B: Current Time Line

**Red line indicator** shows exactly where you are in the day:
- **Horizontal red line** at current time
- **Red dot** on left side
- **Updates every minute** automatically
- Only shows during visible hours (6 AM - 10 PM)

**Visual:**
```
┌──────────────┐
│   Monday     │ ← Today (green background)
├──────────────┤
│  9 AM        │
│              │
│ 10 AM        │
│              │
│ 11 AM ━━━━━━ │ ← Red line (current time: 11:23 AM)
│              │
│ 12 PM        │
└──────────────┘
```

### How It Works
1. **On page load**: Checks current date and time
2. **Highlights today**: Adds green styling to current day column
3. **Adds time line**: Red line at current hour/minute position
4. **Auto-updates**: Line moves every minute

### Benefits
✅ **Never lose track** of where you are in the week  
✅ **Instant awareness** of current time  
✅ **Visual context** for planning  
✅ **Auto-updating** - always accurate
